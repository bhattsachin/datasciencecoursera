# Cleans and creates tidy dataset from Human Activity Recognition Using Smartphones Dataset

Data is split into training and test set, during the first part we merge the two sets together. In addition to split into test and train, the feature vector is seperated from labels and subjects. So we bind 3 files from 2 sets and then combine Subject, activity and sensor feature vectors into a common file.

These steps are available in run_analysis.Rmd
